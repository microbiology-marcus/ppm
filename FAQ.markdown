### Materials & Durability

#### What's the difference between paint and thermoplastic markings?
Paint is cost-effective and quick to apply but wears faster. Thermoplastic is more durable and reflective, making it ideal for high-traffic roads and long-term use.

#### How long do pavement markings last?
Painted lines typically last 6–12 months, depending on traffic and weather. Thermoplastic and epoxy can last 3–5 years or longer.

#### Do markings require maintenance or touch-ups?
Yes. Depending on traffic and wear, regular maintenance ensures visibility and compliance—especially in parking lots or safety-critical zones.

### Compliance & Customization

#### Do you provide ADA-compliant markings?
Absolutely. We are familiar with federal and local regulations and ensure proper signage, spacing, and markings for handicap-accessible parking.

#### Can you match custom layouts or corporate branding?
Yes. We can work with custom layouts, color schemes, or stencils to match your branding or site plans.

#### Are your materials environmentally friendly?
We use low-VOC, waterborne paints and sustainable practices where possible. Let us know if you have specific environmental requirements.

### Weather, Conditions & Surface Prep

#### Can you do markings in cold or wet weather?
Weather impacts performance and drying times. We monitor conditions closely and schedule jobs accordingly for optimal results.

#### Do I need to prepare the surface before you arrive?
We handle surface cleaning and layout, but it helps if the area is cleared of vehicles and debris ahead of time.

#### What are your payment terms?
We accept most major payment methods and typically require a deposit for large projects. Full payment is due upon completion unless otherwise arranged.

#### Are you licensed and insured?
Yes. We are fully licensed and insured to operate in our service area, ensuring compliance and peace of mind.
